# Overview

This Weather Forecast Console Program is a Java application that retrieves weather data from the OpenWeather API to 
display current weather conditions and a 3-day forecast for a specified city by entering the longitude and 
latitude coordinates.

This project was selected to demonstrate the basics of Java and to apply fundamental programming skills and concepts,
aiding in the process of learning a new programming language.

# Future Work

- Add a Read and Write to file feature
- Add Geocoding and Reverse Geocoding features to auto-return the city or location name 
(if lon-lat coordinates are provided) and vise versa
- Refactor for a better OOP, reduce dependencies, and add more validation/exceptions handling 
(e.g. create more interfaces, classes, etc.)
